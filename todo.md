 Cleaning up:
 ☐ use jquery for basic DOM manipulation (like toggleClass for hide/show?)
 ☐ don't show the badge if it's your own comment!
 ✔ use ajax for update @done (15-03-28 22:43)
 ✔ click on chicken text to unchickenify @done (15-03-25 22:14)
 ✔ pick one method for changed page function @done (15-03-28 22:44)
   ✔ start with just user log comments @done (15-03-28 22:43)
 ✔ figure out storage method for options @done (15-03-28 22:44)
 ☐ basic option page
 ☐ new branch for hide users stuff
 ☐ error checking for storage (might be empty!)
 ✔ when is highlighting affected? does reading the rss do it?  nope @done (15-11-16 11:34)
 ☐ what about just using the pubdate compared to date/time of last visit?
 ☐ save and retrieval user id
 ☐ generate discussion page url from user id
 



Future:
 ☐ http://d3js.org/ for graphing, though probably not for this project
 ☐ stardate time option
