 Cleaning up:
 ☐ use jquery for basic DOM manipulation (like toggleClass for hide/show?)
 ☐ use ajax for update
 ☐ popup for options?
 ✔ click on chicken text to unchickenify @done (15-03-25 22:14)
 ☐ pick one method for changed page function
   ☐ start with just user log comments
 ☐ figure out storage method for options
 ☐ basic option page
 ☐ new branch for hide users stuff


Future:
 ☐ http://d3js.org/ for graphing, though probably not for this project
