    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or share any personal data when you use our extension. Our extension does not track your browsing activity, nor do we collect any personally identifiable information.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Clipboard Access</h2>
    <p>Our extension requires temporary access to your clipboard for its core functionality. Specifically, the extension accesses the clipboard to enable DOMA link embedding. This access is only used for the functionality of the extension and is not shared, transmitted, or stored outside your device. We do not retain or collect any data from your clipboard after it has been processed.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Settings Storage</h2>
    <p>The extension may store basic settings locally on your device to personalize your experience, such as a list of settings. These settings are stored only on your device and are not shared with any external servers or services. No personal data is collected or transmitted.</p>
    
    <h2>4. No Third-Party Integration</h2>
    <p>Our extension does not integrate with any third-party services, nor does it send any data to third parties. We do not use analytics tools, ad networks, or any external services that collect user data.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>We take your privacy seriously. The extension only interacts with your clipboard when required for its functionality and does not retain or share any data. There is no data storage on external servers, and no personal information is stored or used.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any changes.</p>
